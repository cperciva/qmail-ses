qmail-ses usage
===============

The qmail-ses tool installs into /var/qmail/bin/qmail-remote-ses and acts as a
drop-in replacement for qmail-remote.  (Creating a link from qmail-remote to
qmail-remote-ses is left as an exercise for the user.)

It uses three control files:
/var/qmail/control/ca-bundle.crt	-- CA bundle for Amazon SES endpoints
/var/qmail/control/ses-key		-- AWS credentials
/var/qmail/control/ses-region		-- AWS region

These paths can be overridden via compiler defines.

The AWS credential file should have two lines:
ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
ACCESS_KEY_SECRET=...

The AWS region file should have a single line consisting of the region name.
